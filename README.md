# About Project
### It is an algorithm that finds the correct path from S to F point.

Start point where the user starts to try to find the F(Final) point. You have to put P(Path) between S(Start) and F(Final) point in order to user to find the exit. There have to be only one way from S to F, but you can put numbers of dead ends. You can design the maze whatever size you want. The output will give the path from S to F as 1.

#### In "girdi.txt" file, you design the maze as these characters:

- #### W --> Block
- #### S --> Start Point
- #### F --> End Point
- #### P --> Path
